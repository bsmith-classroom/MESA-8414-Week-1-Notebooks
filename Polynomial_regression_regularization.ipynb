    "## Regularization examples with varying lambda values\n",
    "This notebook creates a small model and shows how it varies when using L1 and L2 regularization. It also shows how changing the value of the `lambda` (Î») parameter in L1 and L2 regularization shrink the model coefficients and reduce the changes of overfitting the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code is modified from the excellent [example](https://github.com/luisguiserrano/manning/tree/master/Chapter_04_Testing_Overfitting_Underfitting) in Chapter 4 of Luis Serrano's [_Grokking Machine Learning_](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-machine-learning). The major difference is some additional examples at the end that show how lasso and ridge regression change with different lambda values."
